# surfs_up

### Purpose
    - Analyze the data given to determine the behavior of the climate if it is worthwhile or 
    not to open a surf shop that also offers ice cream, for this reason it will be important 
    to determine the frequency of precipitation and its temperature.

### Results
    - There are 283 more records in the entire dataset in June than in December.
    - December data is slightly more spread out than June image(A-1, A-2).

    - 50% of the June data is at 75 degrees while the December data is at 71 degrees image(B-1, B-2).

### Summary
    - First it is worth determining how both months are in context with respect to the other months 
    of the year image(C-1)

    - If we look at the graph in the month of June, the temperature is increasing, so we could say that the ice 
    cream shop for that time is very good to open it, but if we observe the month of December, it is decreasing, 
    which is not a good time to open the ice cream shop.
    
    - But to determine if the second part of the business that is surfing is worth it for those times, we must 
    also analyze both months in context image(D-1).

    - As we can see in the month of June there were more rains than in previous years of December, we can also 
    observe that the data for 2010, 2012, 2015 and 2016 present unusual behavior in some months.
    - The month in which they all agree that there is a low amount of rain in the area is April and May. It 
    would be a matter of observing if the business will be more profitable for the surfing area than the ice 
    cream area, it is something that should be evaluated.
    - The year 2017 is left out because there are months that do not have information.
    - The following functions were created to create the graphs of the whole months in one the year data is obtained

    - We could determine which days are hotter in both months June image(E-1), December image(E-2)

    - As we can see there are more hot days in June than in December, however in both it can be seen that the 
    weather is almost standard throughout the month, with slight falls, although the falls in December according 
    to the data collected are greater from December 5 to 10 .
    - If we turn the analysis around and look for the coldest days in June image(F-1) and in December image(F-2).

    - We can see that as June ends there are more cold days.
    - However in December there are constant ups and downs of cold days.
    - Both analyzes are taken into account in terms of the average.
